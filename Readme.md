## Tic Tac Doge

### Live Demo
[See it live here](https://chrisisthis.github.io/tic-tac-doge/)

### Description
This is [one of the FCC Advanced Front End Development Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-tic-tac-toe-game). 
This game is a fun, silly way to pass the time. You can pick your side, reset, and replay. Winning and losing display different images.
Currently I would describe the level of the computer as defensively intermediate and novice on offense. It is definitely beatable, but 
not always.

### Challenges 
A replayable game requires thoughtful construction of functions and more of a system design than limited function apps. Additionally, 
it was a fun challenge to logic through the computer's moves. 

### Known Issues
- [ ] Non-mobile responsive

### Future Updates
- [ ] setTimeout for computer so it feels like it's "thinking"
- [ ] Mobile friendly (especially images)
- [ ] Different difficulty levels
